Program to display three equations using Matplotlib. 
plottask.py
Author: Gerry Donnelly

This program displays the plot of three equations, f(x), g(x**2) and h(x**3) in the range [0-4] using Matplotlib. 

The program is intended to test out some of the capability of Matplotlib to create and display plots. 

Program Operation. 
The program is run as plottask.py
1. The program requires no user input, it is intended as a demonstration of some of the matplotlib plotting capabilities. 
2. The program displays the plots for three simple functions, f(x), g(x**2), h(x**3) in the range 0 - 4. 
3. When the user runs the program the plot is output and displayed on screen and also saved as a .png file in the same folder as the program.
4. When the user closes the plot displayed on screen the program terminates.
