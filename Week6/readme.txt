Program to calculate Square Root using Newtons Method.
Squareroot.py
Author: Gerry Donnelly

This method uses successive iterations of the formula: root = 0.5 * (X + (N / X)) where X is any guess which can be assumed to be N or 1. 
The user can also input a desired accuracy level, for legibility the output is rounded to 4 decimal places. 

Program Operation
1. The program is run as Squareroot.py
2. The program requests the user to input the number to be rooted. 
3. The program requests the user to input a desired accuracy level, e.g. 99.99.
4. The program outputs the result of the calculation. 

Note thsi method provide only an approximation of the true value of ythe root but the level of accuracy may be sufficient for most purposes.
